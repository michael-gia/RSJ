        <h2>Welcome to Rancho San Julian!</h2>
        <p>Our family has been working this land for over 175 years...
            We are eager to share its unique story with you.
        </p>
        <p>Nestled in the heart of Santa Barbara County, Rancho San Julian
            has the distinction of being one of the last, great Spanish-Mexican
            land grants that remains in the family of the original grantee.
        </p>
        <p>A majestic oasis of old California, the Rancho has retained its natural
            beauty and the functionality of its historic buildings, while enhancing
            its vital agricultural operations. Wildlife thrive in thick oak forests,
            and cattle roam the rolling hills, vast pastures, and steep arroyos that
            comprise Rancho San Julian's 13,000 acres.
        </p>
        <p>We hope you will appreciate the beauty and wonder of Rancho San Julian as much as we do.
        </p>
